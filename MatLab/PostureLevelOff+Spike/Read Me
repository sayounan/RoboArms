This is probably not how you're supposed to do this, but fuck it, here are the instructions for this shit so everyone can try it out
First run "Load_and_plot" to move the raw data into a structure that will be compatible with the rest of the code

That should create a structure named "EMG", save it to your machine, name it w/e you like, repeat for validation data

Load the EMG structure into "filter_loops" this will apply the digital filters. Save the "EMGfilt" structure, repeat for validation

Load your filtered data into "Off_Removal_Posture_Level" be sure to comment out all but one of the plotting sections or you'll only see the last set of plots
Save the "EMG_on" structure, repeat for validation data

Load your on data into "Feature_Extraction3" this will calculate your MAV, ZC, SSC, and WL. Save the "EMG_feat" structure, repeat for validation data

*IMPORTANT: WHEN YOU RUN THIS BIT OF CODE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE STRUCTURES IN THE CODE BETWEEN TRAINING AND VALIDATION DATA, THE NEXT PROGRAM 
WILL NOT WORK IF YOUR TRAINING DATA IS NOT "EMG_feat" AND YOU VALIDATION DATA IS NOT "EMG_feat_Val". There may be a way to automate that, but I don't know it,
so the easiest thing to do is change line 9 in this code to the correct identifier and use Matlab's "shift+enter" shortcut to change the following instances of it

Load your training and validation data into "LDA_Classifier" and see how it does, since fixing the math error the highest accuracy I've gotten was like 50% ish
